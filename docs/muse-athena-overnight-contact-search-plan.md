# Muse Athena Overnight Contact Research Plan

## Goal
Determine whether there is an overnight-safe contact aid (for example, EEG gel/paste/saline methods) that materially improves Muse Athena setup signal quality when users are connected but still fail readiness.

## What We Are Searching For (and Why)

1. **Muse S Athena electrode design and intended contact method**
   Why: Confirm whether the device is intended for dry contact only, and whether conductive gel/paste is recommended or discouraged by the manufacturer.

2. **Official Muse troubleshooting for low setup readiness**
   Why: Establish manufacturer-approved fixes first, before suggesting third-party products or techniques.

3. **Evidence on dry-electrode EEG contact aids**
   Why: Validate which interventions measurably improve signal quality for dry electrodes (saline, conductive gel, conductive paste, hydrogel).

4. **Overnight performance and dry-out behavior**
   Why: Water often helps briefly but dries out; we need approaches that can maintain conductivity for a full sleep window.

5. **Skin safety for prolonged forehead and mastoid/ear-area use**
   Why: Overnight wear increases irritation and allergy risk; recommendations must be safe for multi-hour contact.

6. **Material compatibility and cleanup considerations**
   Why: Some gels/pastes can foul contacts or be difficult to remove; recommendations must not damage electrodes or plastics.

7. **Diagnostics-to-cause mapping for this failure pattern**
   Why: The observed pattern is "connected but low good EEG"; we need to separate contact/artifact failures from true transport/connectivity failures.

8. **Plain-English guidance for setup UI**
   Why: Convert technical checks into user actions: which sensor areas to adjust, what to apply, and what to do differently for overnight use.

## Expected Outputs

1. A ranked recommendation set (safe/no-go/conditional) for overnight contact aids.
2. A concise explanation for untrained users of why setup can fail despite connection.
3. Setup modal copy updates that are text-first and accessible (including sensor-area-specific actions).
4. A support runbook decision tree: contact/artifact branch vs transport branch.
