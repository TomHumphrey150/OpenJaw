# Bruxism commonly causes throat symptoms through a validated muscle chain pathway

**Your experience is not unusual.** Clinical literature, anatomical research, and patient reports consistently document that chronic bruxism and TMJ dysfunction cause throat symptoms including globus sensation, throat tightness, and swallowing difficulties. Your hypothesis about a muscle tension chain affecting the hyoid bone and larynx is anatomically correct and clinically validated.

## The connection is established in medical literature

A landmark 1985 randomized controlled trial by Kirveskari and Puhakka directly tested whether TMJ treatment resolves throat symptoms. Of 22 patients with globus sensation who had signs of TMJ dysfunction, those receiving occlusal adjustment showed statistically significant improvement—at **20-44 month follow-up, 20 of 22 patients reported improvement**. This remains the strongest direct evidence that treating jaw dysfunction resolves throat symptoms.

Systematic reviews confirm substantial prevalence. Gilheaney et al.'s 2018 meta-analysis found **9.3% of TMD patients have impaired swallowing**, while an Irish cohort study documented swallowing difficulties in **53% of TMD patients**. A 2017 clinical review in the *Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology* explicitly lists throat symptoms of bruxism as: "swallowing difficulties and sore throat without infection, laryngitis, voice irregularities, frequent coughing or constant clearing of throat, **feeling of foreign object in throat**."

Sleep studies provide physiological confirmation. Miyawaki et al. (2003) found that bruxism patients showed **6.8 swallowing-related laryngeal movements per hour versus 3.7 in controls**—demonstrating direct physiological coupling between bruxism and laryngeal activity.

## Your muscle chain hypothesis is anatomically validated

The pathway you propose—mastication muscles to suprahyoid muscles to hyoid bone to larynx—is documented in medical anatomy texts. Critically, the **suprahyoid muscles are formally classified as "accessory muscles of mastication"** according to StatPearls (NCBI), recognizing their functional integration with jaw movement.

The mechanical chain works as follows:

- **Digastric, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid muscles** directly connect the mandible to the hyoid bone
- The **thyrohyoid membrane and thyrohyoid muscle** connect the hyoid directly to the thyroid cartilage of the larynx
- When bruxism creates sustained jaw muscle contraction, it co-activates the suprahyoid muscles
- **Hypertonic suprahyoid muscles pull on the hyoid bone**, requiring compensatory contraction of infrahyoid muscles and pharyngeal constrictors
- This compensation cascade produces throat tension, altered larynx position, and sensations of tightness or obstruction

Research on myofascial pain-dysfunction syndrome confirms this spread pattern: "Repetition of these parafunctional maneuvers establishes a self-perpetuating cycle of pain and muscle spasm, which **often spreads beyond the muscles of mastication** to involve other muscle groups (sternocleidomastoid, trapezius, posterior cervical) in the head and neck region."

## Specific trigger points explain globus sensation directly

Travell and Simons' authoritative *Myofascial Pain and Dysfunction: The Trigger Point Manual* documents that **medial pterygoid trigger points** cause "poorly circumscribed pain projecting to the back of the mouth and pharynx" along with "difficult and painful swallowing." Multiple TMJ specialists report that globus sensation in their patients often originates from trigger points in the medial pterygoid, posterior digastric, and sternocleidomastoid muscles.

Dr. Ira Shapira, a TMJ specialist, states: "The constant lump in your throat can have numerous causes but one of the most frequent is referred feelings from trigger points in the Medial Pterygoid muscle." He adds that "throat pain is a common symptom of TMJ disorders" and that he "frequently sees patients with similar combinations of symptoms."

## The trigeminal nerve pathway connects jaw to throat neurologically

Beyond mechanical muscle connections, the **trigeminocervical complex (TCC)** provides a neurological pathway. The spinal trigeminal nucleus extends from the pons down to cervical spinal cord levels C2-C4, where it converges with sensory input from:

- Trigeminal nerve (V)—jaw and face sensation
- Glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)—pharynx and throat sensation  
- Vagus nerve (X)—pharynx and larynx

This anatomical convergence allows **bidirectional referral of sensations** between jaw structures and throat. TMJ dysfunction can sensitize trigeminal pathways, producing referred sensations in glossopharyngeal/vagal territory—explaining why jaw problems create throat symptoms even when the throat itself is anatomically normal.

A February 2024 case report demonstrated this connection clinically: a patient with globus symptoms and C1 vertebral misalignment experienced complete resolution of throat complaints after cervical manual therapy, supporting the craniocervical-throat relationship.

## Patient experiences validate this as a common pattern

Across TMJ specialist patient forums and clinical Q&A sites, bruxism sufferers consistently describe this symptom cluster:

| Symptom | Typical Patient Description |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Globus sensation | "I live with an almost constant feeling of a lump in the throat" |
| Dysphagia sensation | "I suddenly come to a halt and am unable to begin the swallowing process" |
| Throat tightness | "I'm experiencing throat and chest tightness" |
| Combined symptoms | "Ear pain, stiff neck, shoulders, trouble swallowing and headaches" |

Importantly, patients report that **treating bruxism/TMJ improves throat symptoms**. One patient testimonial: "Prior to treatment, Janet frequently experienced a sore throat, among other symptoms. However, following a customized treatment plan that included an oral device to adjust her bite, Janet's symptoms diminished considerably."

The pattern you describe appears **moderately common but underrecognized**—not the primary presenting complaint for most bruxism patients, but frequently experienced alongside jaw symptoms. Many patients report extensive ENT workups finding nothing before TMJ dysfunction is identified as the cause.

## Severe or chronic bruxism correlates with more widespread symptoms

Clinical literature supports that chronic bruxism leads to progressive symptom spread. Aguilera et al. (2017) note that "over time, chronic clenching of the jaw leads to hypertrophy of masseters and temporalis musculature"—indicating that sustained bruxism produces structural muscle changes that worsen the tension cascade.

Studies on TMD severity and neck involvement found that **70% of TMD patients have concurrent neck pain**, and that segmental limitations at C0-C3 levels are significantly more present in TMD patients. High levels of muscle tenderness in upper trapezius and temporalis muscles correlate with high levels of both jaw and neck dysfunction, suggesting a dose-response relationship between jaw muscle hyperactivity and regional muscle involvement.

Research on botulinum toxin treatment provides further evidence: studies found that "reduction of muscle hyperactivity may determine a reduction of tension in all cervical muscles"—confirming that treating jaw muscle tension reduces tension throughout the connected muscle chain.

## Conclusion: your experience is clinically recognized

The pattern **bruxism → jaw tension → neck tension → throat symptoms** is:

- **Anatomically validated** through documented suprahyoid muscle connections to hyoid and larynx
- **Clinically supported** by RCT evidence showing TMJ treatment resolves globus
- **Neurologically explained** by trigeminocervical complex convergence
- **Consistently reported** by patients in TMJ communities
- **Recognized by specialists** though often missed by general practitioners

Your experience falls within a recognized symptom pattern. The primary clinical implication is that **treating the bruxism should improve throat symptoms**—which the 1985 Kirveskari study and multiple patient testimonials confirm. Treatment approaches shown to help include custom oral appliances/splints, neuromuscular orthotics, physical therapy targeting jaw and neck muscles, trigger point therapy, and stress management to reduce clenching.

While this connection is documented in peer-reviewed literature, researchers consistently note it remains **"understudied"** compared to primary TMJ symptoms. You are not experiencing something unusual—rather, you're experiencing a recognized but often-overlooked consequence of chronic bruxism that may require specifically informing your healthcare providers about the jaw-throat connection.
