# The 10 Pillars of Human Health

A structured, evidence-based framework for optimal health and longevity.

---

## 1. Sleep

Sleep is the foundation of health. Irregular sleep schedules are associated with adverse mental, physical, cognitive, and behavioural health outcomes. People who get recommended sleep durations are significantly more likely to be flourishing across happiness, productivity, and social life (NSF 2025).

### 1.1 Duration
- **7–9 hours per night** for adults (AASM / Sleep Research Society consensus)
- Consistently getting <7h increases risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and all-cause mortality

### 1.2 Regularity
- **Consistent sleep-wake schedule** every day, including weekends
- Sleep regularity may matter as much or more than duration (Sleep Medicine Reviews, 2025 systematic review)
- Social jetlag (weekend schedule shifts) is independently associated with worse cardiometabolic and mental health outcomes

### 1.3 Environment
- **Temperature**: 17–20°C (63–68°F) for most adults; evidence shows sleep efficiency drops 5–10% when bedroom temp rises above 25°C
- **Darkness**: Complete darkness is optimal; avoid blue light exposure during the sleep window
- **Noise**: Below 35 dB; consider white noise or earplugs if intermittent noise cannot be eliminated
- **Humidity**: 40–60% relative humidity
- **Mattress & bedding**: Replace mattresses showing visible sagging or >10 years old

### 1.4 Sleep Hygiene Behaviours
- **Caffeine**: Avoid after early afternoon (effects can last 6+ hours)
- **Alcohol**: Avoid in the evening — causes sleep fragmentation and reduces REM sleep
- **Meals**: Finish eating at least 3 hours before bed; avoid heavy meals at night
- **Screens**: Devices off at least 30–60 minutes before bed
- **Wind-down routine**: 60 minutes of relaxing activity before bed (warm bath/shower, reading, light stretching)

### 1.5 Light Exposure
- **Morning sunlight**: Get bright/natural light exposure early in the day to anchor circadian rhythm
- **Evening**: Dim lights progressively; blue-light blocking glasses if using screens

### 1.6 Napping
- Keep naps to 20–30 minutes, before 5 PM
- Power naps can boost cognitive performance, memory, and mood

### 1.7 Sleep Disorders
- Be aware of signs of sleep apnoea, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, and bruxism
- CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia) is first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, preferred over medication

## 2. Nutrition

Dietary patterns are among the strongest modifiable determinants of healthspan and longevity. Mediterranean, DASH, and plant-forward diets consistently demonstrate reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (ACC, 2025 Dietary Guidelines review; Nature Medicine, 2025).

### 2.1 Dietary Pattern
- **Plant-forward**: Emphasise vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds
- **Mediterranean / DASH patterns** have the strongest evidence base for longevity and disease prevention
- **Minimally processed**: Limit ultra-processed foods, added sugars, and refined grains
- **Nutrient density**: Every calorie should carry nutritional value

### 2.2 Macronutrients
- **Protein**: Minimum ~0.8 g/kg body weight; 1.2–1.6 g/kg for active adults and those over 50; prioritise plant proteins (legumes, nuts, soy), seafood, then lean meats
- **Fibre**: At least 25–30 g/day — one of the most consistently under-consumed nutrients
- **Healthy fats**: Olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado, omega-3 rich seafood; limit saturated fat to <10% of calories
- **Carbohydrates**: Whole grains, vegetables, and fruits; limit refined sugars and starches

### 2.3 Micronutrients
- **Vitamin D**: Many adults are deficient; 1000–2000 IU/day is commonly recommended
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: From oily fish 2×/week or supplementation
- **Magnesium**: Important for sleep, muscle function, and mood; many diets are deficient
- **Iron, Zinc, B12**: Monitor especially on plant-based diets

### 2.4 Hydration
- **Water**: ~2–3 litres/day (varies by size, activity, climate)
- **Clean water**: Use filtration if local water quality is a concern; be aware of lead and contaminants in older plumbing
- **Limit**: Sugary drinks, excessive caffeine

### 2.5 Meal Timing & Structure
- **Consistent meal times**: Supports circadian rhythm
- **Time-restricted eating**: Some evidence for metabolic benefits from 8–12 hour eating windows; caloric restriction shows anti-aging potential in research but long-term human data is still emerging
- **Don't skip meals erratically**: Leads to poor food choices and blood sugar instability

### 2.6 Supplements
- **Targeted supplementation** to fill genuine gaps (D3, omega-3, magnesium, B12 if plant-based)
- Whole food sources are generally preferred to supplements
- Evidence for most "longevity supplements" (NMN, resveratrol, etc.) is preliminary and largely based on animal models

## 3. Exercise

Physical activity has robust evidence for reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, type-2 diabetes, depression, and all-cause mortality. WHO 2020 guidelines and the AHA recommend a combination of aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance training.

### 3.1 Aerobic / Cardio
- **150–300 minutes/week** of moderate-intensity (brisk walking, cycling), OR
- **75–150 minutes/week** of vigorous-intensity (running, HIIT, swimming), OR
- An equivalent combination of both
- More is generally better — additional benefits beyond 300 minutes/week, with diminishing returns

### 3.2 Strength Training
- **At least 2 days/week** involving all major muscle groups
- Progressive overload: gradually increase resistance over time
- Critical for maintaining muscle mass, bone density, metabolic health, and functional independence with age
- Strength training benefits are independent of aerobic activity

### 3.3 Flexibility
- Regular stretching improves range of motion and reduces injury risk
- Yoga, Pilates, or dedicated stretching routines
- Especially important as a complement to strength training

### 3.4 Balance & Coordination
- Particularly important from age 40+ to prevent falls
- Examples: single-leg stands, tandem walking, tai chi
- WHO specifically recommends multicomponent physical activity for older adults (65+)

### 3.5 Daily Movement & Sedentary Behaviour
- **Break up prolonged sitting** every 30 minutes with brief movement
- Active commuting (walking, cycling) is independently associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
- Any physical activity is better than none — even small amounts below guidelines provide health benefits

### 3.6 VO2 Max / Cardiorespiratory Fitness
- A strong predictor of all-cause mortality
- Aim to maintain or improve through regular vigorous exercise
- Measurable via fitness tests or wearable estimates

### 3.7 Posture
- Maintain upright posture; avoid prolonged forward head position (especially from phone use)
- Strengthen postural muscles through targeted exercises
- Move every ~30 minutes to reset posture and blood flow

## 4. Social Life

Social connection is a critical and underappreciated determinant of health. Lacking social connection increases mortality risk by 26–32% — comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes/day and exceeding the risk from obesity and physical inactivity (Holt-Lunstad meta-analysis, 308,849 participants; US Surgeon General Advisory 2023; WHO Commission on Social Connection 2025).

### 4.1 Close Relationships
- **Family bonds**: Maintain and invest in relationships with family members
- **Deep friendships**: Cultivate a small number of high-quality, reciprocal friendships
- **Romantic partnership**: Invest in shared experiences, communication, and emotional intimacy

### 4.2 Community & Belonging
- **Group membership**: Clubs, sports teams, religious communities, hobby groups, volunteering
- People with strong community belongingness are 2.6× more likely to report good/excellent health
- **Social participation**: Regular social interaction protects against cognitive decline and dementia (50% risk reduction)

### 4.3 Quantity & Quality
- Both matter: a larger social network AND higher quality relationships independently predict better health
- Multidimensional social integration (varied types of social ties) is the strongest predictor of survival

### 4.4 Proactive Connection
- Schedule regular social activities; don't rely on spontaneity
- Reach out first — initiate plans, check in on friends
- Be present: put devices away during social time

### 4.5 Boundaries & Toxic Relationships
- Not all social contact is health-promoting; strained or abusive relationships increase stress and health risk
- Set boundaries and prioritise relationships that are supportive and reciprocal

## 5. Stress Management

Chronic stress is associated with inflammation, cardiovascular disease, immune suppression, and mental health disorders. Meta-analyses confirm that stress management interventions produce medium-to-large effects on stress reduction (Cohen's d ≈ 0.53; Richardson & Rothstein). Cognitive-behavioural and mindfulness approaches have the strongest evidence.

### 5.1 Mindfulness & Meditation
- MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) is efficacious for reducing anxiety, stress, and burnout
- Even brief daily practices (10–20 minutes) show benefits
- Meditation and mindfulness interventions effectively lower cortisol levels

### 5.2 Cognitive-Behavioural Techniques
- Cognitive restructuring: identifying and challenging unhelpful thought patterns
- Problem-solving approaches to stressors
- CBT-based stress management consistently produces the largest effect sizes across meta-analyses

### 5.3 Relaxation Practices
- Deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, body scanning
- Effective at reducing both psychological stress and physiological markers (cortisol, blood pressure)

### 5.4 Journaling & Reflection
- Expressive writing reduces rumination and anxiety
- Gratitude journaling linked to improved mood and wellbeing

### 5.5 Work-Life Boundaries
- Set clear boundaries around work hours, email, and notifications
- Flexible work arrangements are associated with improved psychological health and job satisfaction
- "None is easier than some" — firm rules about when to stop working are more sustainable than willpower

### 5.6 Nature Exposure
- Time in green spaces reduces cortisol, blood pressure, and anxiety
- See also: Pillar 9 (Environment)

### 5.7 Clinical Mental Health
- Therapy (CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) for persistent anxiety, depression, trauma, or burnout
- Psychiatric support for medication management when appropriate
- Screen for depression and anxiety proactively; don't wait for crisis

## 6. Avoiding Harmful Substances

Substance avoidance is one of the highest-impact health behaviours. Smoking, excessive alcohol, and drug use are leading causes of preventable death.

### 6.1 Tobacco & Nicotine
- Smoking is the single largest preventable cause of death globally
- No safe level of smoking; even "light" smoking increases cardiovascular risk
- Nicotine is a stimulant that disrupts sleep and increases blood pressure
- Vaping: long-term risks uncertain, but not harm-free

### 6.2 Alcohol
- Even moderate drinking is associated with increased cancer risk (particularly breast, liver, colorectal)
- No amount of alcohol is confirmed to be beneficial for health (Lancet Global Burden of Disease)
- Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture, impairs recovery, and adds empty calories
- If drinking, limit to ≤1 standard drink/day (and not daily)

### 6.3 Recreational Drugs
- Cannabis: impairs sleep quality (despite sedative effects), cognitive function, and motivation with heavy use
- Stimulants (cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines): cardiovascular risk, neurotoxicity, addiction potential
- Opioids: extremely high addiction and overdose risk

### 6.4 Prescription Drug Awareness
- Use medications as prescribed; avoid unnecessary polypharmacy
- Be aware of dependencies (benzodiazepines, opioid painkillers, sleep medications)
- Review medication regimen with your doctor periodically

## 7. Medical

Preventive healthcare, early detection, and proactive management of medical conditions are essential for healthspan.

### 7.1 Preventive Screenings
- **Blood work**: Annual or bi-annual comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, HbA1c, CBC, thyroid function
- **Blood pressure**: Check regularly; target <120/80 mmHg
- **Cancer screenings**: Follow age-appropriate guidelines (colonoscopy, skin checks, cervical/breast/prostate as relevant)
- **Eye exams**: Every 1–2 years
- **Hearing**: Baseline and periodic checks from age 50+

### 7.2 Oral Health
- **Brush** twice daily with fluoride toothpaste
- **Floss** daily
- **Dental checkups**: Every 6 months for professional cleaning and early detection of caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer
- **Tongue scraping**: Reduces bacterial load
- **Bruxism**: Address grinding with a night guard or dental device if present — chronic bruxism damages teeth and disrupts sleep
- **Limit sugar and acidic drinks**: Major drivers of caries

### 7.3 Skincare
- **SPF**: Daily broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+) on exposed skin, year-round
- **Moisturise**: Maintain skin barrier integrity
- **Retinol**: Evidence-supported for reducing photoaging (use at night)
- **Avoid sunburn**: Cover up during peak UV hours (10am–4pm); sun damage is the #1 cause of skin aging
- **Self-check**: Monitor moles and skin changes; annual dermatology check

### 7.4 Biomarker Tracking & Measurement
- **Wearables**: Track sleep, heart rate, HRV, activity (Apple Watch, Oura, Whoop, etc.)
- **Regular blood work**: Track trends over time, not just single snapshots
- **Body composition**: Track weight, body fat %, waist circumference
- **Functional markers**: Grip strength, VO2 max, resting heart rate

### 7.5 Physiotherapy & Injury Prevention
- Address musculoskeletal issues early (don't wait for chronic pain)
- Prehabilitation: strengthening and mobility work to prevent injuries
- Regular mobility and joint health assessments

### 7.6 Vaccinations & Immune Health
- Stay current with recommended vaccinations (flu, COVID boosters, shingles for 50+, etc.)
- Support immune function through sleep, nutrition, exercise, and stress management

## 8. Romantic / Personal Care

Self-care and grooming contribute to self-confidence, relationship health, and physical maintenance. These are often overlooked as health behaviours.

### 8.1 Hair Care
- Regular haircuts and maintenance
- Address hair loss early if concerned (minoxidil, nutrition, scalp care)
- Proper nutrition supports hair health (protein, biotin, iron, zinc, omega-3s)

### 8.2 Body Hygiene
- Daily washing / showering
- Regular handwashing (primary infection prevention measure)
- Nail care and maintenance

### 8.3 Grooming
- Shaving / beard maintenance
- Skincare routine (overlap with Medical pillar for SPF and moisturiser)
- Personal presentation as a form of self-respect

### 8.4 Sexual Health
- **Regular sexual activity / masturbation**: Associated with improved mood, sleep, prostate health (in men), and stress reduction
- **STI screening**: Regular testing if sexually active with new partners
- **Contraception**: Evidence-based methods appropriate to your situation
- **Pelvic floor health**: Exercises benefit both men and women

### 8.5 Clothing & Comfort
- Dress appropriately for temperature and activity
- Invest in comfortable, well-fitting clothes that support self-confidence

## 9. Environment

Environmental factors significantly influence health through direct physical mechanisms and indirect effects on mood, cognition, and behaviour.

### 9.1 Air Quality
- Indoor air quality matters: ventilate living spaces, use air purifiers if needed
- Reduce exposure to pollutants, mould, and volatile organic compounds
- Avoid living or exercising near heavy traffic when possible

### 9.2 Light Exposure
- **Morning sunlight**: 10–30 minutes within the first hour of waking to regulate circadian rhythm
- **Afternoon sun**: Beneficial for vitamin D synthesis and mood
- **Avoid UV damage**: Protect during peak hours (see Medical pillar)
- **Evening**: Reduce artificial light exposure; use warm/dim lighting

### 9.3 Nature & Green Space
- Regular time in natural environments reduces stress, blood pressure, and cortisol
- Aim for regular outdoor activity — even urban parks provide benefit
- Forest bathing, gardening, hiking, and outdoor exercise all count

### 9.4 Ergonomics & Workspace
- Desk height, monitor position, and chair support to reduce musculoskeletal strain
- Standing desks or sit-stand alternatives
- Keyboard and mouse positioning to prevent repetitive strain

### 9.5 Posture (Daily Living)
- Phone use: hold at eye level to reduce neck strain
- Move every ~30 minutes
- Strengthen core and postural muscles (see Exercise pillar)

### 9.6 Noise
- Chronic noise exposure (traffic, construction, loud environments) is associated with cardiovascular risk and sleep disruption
- Use hearing protection in loud environments
- Create quiet spaces for rest and focus

### 9.7 Temperature & Climate
- Maintain comfortable indoor temperatures (18–22°C for general living; 17–20°C for sleep)
- Dress appropriately for weather; avoid chronic cold or heat exposure
- Be aware of climate-related health risks (heat stress, air quality during wildfires)

## 10. Financial Security

Financial stress is a potent determinant of health. Economic stability enables access to healthcare, nutrition, safe housing, and reduces chronic stress.

### 10.1 Emergency Fund
- 3–6 months of living expenses as a buffer against financial shocks
- Reduces anxiety and decision-making under duress

### 10.2 Income & Career Stability
- Stable employment is associated with better physical and mental health outcomes
- Career development and skill-building as long-term health investments
- Job satisfaction and autonomy are protective against burnout

### 10.3 Healthcare Access
- Maintain adequate health insurance / coverage
- Budget for preventive care, dental, and specialist visits
- Don't defer medical care due to cost when possible

### 10.4 Housing Security
- Safe, stable, and comfortable housing is foundational
- Adequate heating/cooling, ventilation, and low-toxin environment
- Living near green space and community infrastructure improves outcomes

### 10.5 Financial Literacy & Planning
- Budgeting and tracking spending
- Retirement planning and long-term financial security
- Understanding insurance, tax efficiency, and investment basics

### 10.6 Reducing Financial Stress
- Automate savings and bill payments to reduce cognitive load
- Seek professional advice when facing complex financial decisions
- Avoid high-interest debt; create a debt reduction plan if needed
